# Wet And Cold
Reduces health regeneration penalty that **Wet** and **Cold** status effects apply.

Have you ever died while adventuring in a swamp all wet and cold, which seems to always be the case? Did you wonder if your health regeneration was broken? Cause it might as well be. This mod aims to make adventuring at night, and especially in swamps, viable and a bit more bearable.

## Installation (manual)
- You'll need to download BepInEx for Valheim﻿ if this your first Valheim mod.
- Place the dll file for this mod in **Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/** folder.

## General
- Decreased health regeneration penalty for **Wet** status effect to **-10%** (from -25%)
- Decreased health regeneration penalty for **Cold** status effect to **-20%** (from -50%)

## Notes
- You can tweak the values in the config file (it will appear only after you run the game with the mod at least once): **Valheim/BepInEx/config/bakaSpaceman.WetAndCold.cfg**.
